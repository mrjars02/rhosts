# Removeadhosts

This reroutes sites to 0.0.0.0 in order to block them from being reached by adding them automatically to the hosts file. This was designed off of how Pihole works to block ads but this functions at a local level instead of the entire network.    

## Requirements

- make

- Most linux distros

- curl

## Install

        sudo make install

## Update

        sudo make reinstall
